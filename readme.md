# Pomodoro Timer üçÖ

## Introduction

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Approach

1. **Installation and Setup:**

- The script requires tkinder module to be installed. The `pip` command is used to install necessary libraries

## Setup

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install tkinter
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
   - Execute the Python script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, use `python3` instead:
     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

2. **View the Output:**
   - The script will run and display the tkinter `GUI`[Graphical User Interface] and show the results.
